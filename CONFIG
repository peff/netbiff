Configuration is read from a directory structure which is ordinarily located
in "$HOME/.netbiff". The structure is organized as follows:

.netbiff/frequency
  This file should contain a text integer that indicates the polling
frequency in seconds.

.netbiff/actions/
  This directory should contain a file for every defined action. The name of
the file indicates the name of the action. The contents of the file will be
passed to "sh -c" when the action is executed. There are a few default
actions defined internally. They are:
  - beep - cause an audible beep
  - image - cause the interface to change the mailbox image to "biffed" state
  - image-reset - change the image back to "unbiffed" state

.netbiff/connections/
  This directory should contain a sub-directory for every defined connection.
The name of the sub-directory indicates the name of the connection. The
contents of the directory are described below.

.netbiff/connections/*/command
  This file should contain the command to be passed to "sh -c" to run the
appropriate backend.

.netbiff/connections/*/folders
  This file should contain a list of folders, one per line, that should be
checked for this connection. Defaults to "INBOX".

.netbiff/connections/*/update
  This file should contain a list of actions, one per line, that should be
performed when the connection indicates an update (i.e., when it's biffed).
Defaults to "image" and "beep".

.netbiff/connections/*/reset
  This file should contain a list of actions, one per line, that should be
performed when the connection is reset (i.e., unbiffed). Defaults to
"image-reset".

.netbiff/connections/*/*
  Any other contents of a connection directory will be ignored unless
specifically requested by the backend connection. For example, the
netbiffd-imap backend may request the data "secret/password". In this case,
the file .netbiff/connections/*/secret/password will be accessed.

.netbiff/connections/*/secret
  This directory, if it exists, will contain backend data (such as
secret/password). If it exists, its permissions are checked when netbiff
starts; if it is accessible by group or world permissions, then netbiff will
report an error and halt.


EXAMPLES

Here is a short shell script to create a simple netbiff setup:

mkdir .netbiff
mkdir .netbiff/actions
mkdir .netbiff/connections
# update every 30 seconds 
echo 30 >.netbiff/frequency
# make one IMAP connection to mail.example.org, username foo
mkdir .netbiff/connections/example
echo \
  'exec netbiffd-imap login mail.example.org peff' \
  >.netbiff/connections/example/command
# let's just check the INBOX
echo INBOX >.netbiff/connections/example/folders
# and let's have it beep and change the image on biff
(echo beep; echo image) >.netbiff/connections/example/update
# and reset the image when it unbiffs
(echo image-reset) >.netbiff/connections/example/reset
# Done.

Here's an example that shows converting from the old .netbiffrc format to the
new format. 

--- old .netbiffrc --
frequency 30
action "foo" "echo A biff that biffs... | mail $USER"
connection
	name "local mail"
	command "/usr/local/bin/netbiffd"
	update "image"
	update "beep"
	reset "image-reset"
	folder "/var/spool/mail/mylogin"
	folder "foo"
endconnection
connection name "remote mail"
        command 
	  "ssh remotehost /usr/local/bin/netbiffd-imap preauth /etc/rimapd"
        folder "INBOX"
        update "beep"
        update "foo" 
endconnection

--- new .netbiff shell script ---
mkdir .netbiff; cd .netbiff
  echo 30 >frequency

  mkdir actions; cd actions
    echo 'echo a biff that biffs... | mail $USER' >foo
  cd ..

  mkdir connections; cd connections
    mkdir local; cd local
      echo /usr/local/bin/netbiffd >command
      (echo image; echo beep) >update
      echo image-reset >reset
      echo /var/spool/mail/mylogin >folders
      echo foo >>folders
    cd ..
    mkdir remote; cd remote
      echo \
        "ssh remotehost /usr/local/bin/netbiffd-imap preauth /etc/rimapd" \
        >command
      echo INBOX >folder
      (echo beep; echo foo) >update
      touch reset
    cd ..
  cd ..
cd ..
