Netbiff is an advanced "biff," or mail notification utility, geared towards
checking mailboxes across multiple machines.  Each biff interface can have an
arbitrary number of backends, each supporting a different interface to
examining the mail.  This is release 0.9.  Everything is completed and
thought to work, but the system lacks niceties such as autoconf support. 

The following backends currently exist:
	* BSD mailbox format
	* IMAP4

The current features are implemented:
	* Arbitrary backends that speak a documented protocol
	* Arbitrary backends for each session
	* Pluggable interfaces
		* GTK
		* Text
	* Arbitrary actions on "biff"
	* Graceful retry/abort for failed backend connections
	* Support for polling and event-driven backends
	* Configurable poll frequency
	* Traditional biff "look and feel"

To install:

	./configure
	make
	make install

	# Edit your ~/.netbiffrc (see the file doc/config.txt for details).
	netbiff
