Netbiff is an advanced "biff," or mail notification utility, geared towards
checking mailboxes across multiple machines.  Each biff interface can have an
arbitrary number of backends, each supporting a different interface to
examining the mail.  

The following backends currently exist:
	* BSD mailbox format
	* IMAP4

The current features are implemented:
	* Arbitrary backends that speak a documented protocol
	* Arbitrary backends for each session
	* Pluggable interfaces
		* GTK
		* Text
	* Arbitrary actions on "biff"
	* Graceful retry for failed backend connections
	* Support for polling and event-driven backends
	* Configurable poll frequency
	* Traditional biff "look and feel"

To install:

	./configure
	make
	make install

	# Edit your ~/.netbiff directory (see the file doc/config.txt 
        # for details).
	netbiff
