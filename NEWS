0.9.4:

The GTK interface has been changed to be a little more useful. The old one is
available by doing "netbiff --gui=gtk-old".  Interfaces can now have their
own command line options, separated from the other options by --.  The GTK
interface supports -geometry. So, for example, "netbiff --gui=gtk --
-geometry +300+200" will position the window at (300,200). 

0.9.3:

I've implemented folder reset commands (these are triggered when a folder
de-biffs, and all folders are now in the unbiffed state, indicating that
there is no new mail waiting).  The syntax for attaching an action to a
connection is now changed; update actions are specified with the "update"
keyword, and resets use the "reset" keyword.  There is also a new default
action for resets, "image-reset".  Formerly, the image-reset was done by
default (but now must be specified explicitly).

0.9.2:

I've added autoconf support. This may break some platforms, but it seems to
work ok for me so far.  There are options to set which frontends should be
included (--enable-text and --enable-gtk options to configure); both are
enabled by default.

Theoretically this should just require testing on other platforms. Any
failures to build should be easily added to autoconf. If it doesn't build for
you, please send send me the following information:

Platform (OS and CPU)
Output of ./configure
Any compiler warnings or errors
