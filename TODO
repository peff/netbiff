TODO list:

More backends (POP, maildirs, NNTP)
More robust testing (it works for me...)
Better sharing of flag image (if two go up and one goes down, the image
	becomes unset)
Better handling of negative geometry positions (GTK doesn't appear to have a
	good way of doing this). For example, -0-0 is equal to +0+0.
