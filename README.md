netbiff
=======

Netbiff is a simple and extensible mail-biffer. Its original design
goals were:

   * ability to monitor multiple mailboxes

   * extensibility of user interfaces; the current code supports a text
     interface and a gtk interface

   * extensibility of mail backends; the current code supports mbox and
     imap backends

Netbiff was started in 2000.  Though it does seem to still build and run
flawlessly, these days even I am not using it on a day-to-day basis. I
am posting it here because there has been some interest in the code. Use
with caution!

To build from the git repository, you will need the `mfm` tool. You can
git it here: <http://github.com/peff/mfm>
